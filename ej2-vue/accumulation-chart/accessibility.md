# Accessibility in Vue Accumulation chart component

Accessibility is achieved in the accumulation chart control through WAI-ARIA standard. The accumulation chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the accumulation chart:
