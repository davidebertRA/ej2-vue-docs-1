# Getting Started

This section explains how to create a simple **Card** using styles by configuring the structure for the header, content, using Essential JS 2 [quickstart](https://github.com/syncfusion/ej2-quickstart.git) seed repository.

## Prerequisites

[System requirements for Syncfusion Vue UI components](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/system-requirements/)

## Dependencies

The Card is pure CSS component so no other package dependencies are needed to render the Card.

```js
|-- @syncfusion/ej2-layouts
```

## Get Started with Vue CLI

You can use [`Vue CLI`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) to setup your vue applications.
To install Vue CLI use the following command.

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Start a new project using below Vue CLI command.

```bash
vue init webpack-simple quickstart

cd quickstart
npm install

```

## Adding Syncfusion packages

All the available Essential JS 2 packages are published in [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg) registry.
You can choose the component that you want to install. For this application, we are going to use Card component.

To install Card component, use the following command

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-vue-layouts â€“save
```

## Registering Vue Component

For Registering Vue Component two ways are available. They are as follows.
* Vue.use()
* Vue.component()

Since the Card is a pure CSS component there is no need to refer the scripts

## Creating Vue Sample

Add the HTML div element with **e-card** class into the `<template>` section of the `App.vue` file in src directory, the content attribute of the Card component is provided as name in data option in the `<script>` section.

```
<template>
    <div id="app">
     <div class = "e-card">
          Sample Card
        </div>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import Vue from 'vue';
export default {
  name: 'app',
}
</script>
```

## Adding CSS Reference

Add Card component's styles as given below in `<style>` section of the `App.vue` file.

```
<style>
@import '../../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css';
@import '../../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-vue-layouts/styles/material.css';
</style>
```

## Adding a header and content

You can create Card with a header in a specific structure. For adding header you need to create a `div` element with `e-card-header` class added.

* You can include heading inside the Card header by adding a `div` element with `e-card-header-caption` class, and also content will be added by adding element with `e-card-content`. For detailed information, refer to the [Header and Content](./header-content/).

```
    <div class = "e-card">                    --> Root Element
        <div class="e-card-header">           --> Root Header Element
            <div class="e-card-header-caption">    --> Root Heading Element
                <div class="e-card-header-title"></div>   --> Heading Title Element
            </div>
            <div class="e-card-content"></div>         --> Card content Element
        </div>
    </div>
```

## Running the Application

Now run the `npm run dev` command in the console, it will build your application and open in the browser.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/card/getting-started-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/card/getting-started-cs1" %}
