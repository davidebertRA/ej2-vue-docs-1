# To keep single pane open always in Vue Accordion component

By default, all Accordion panels are collapsible. You can customize the Accordion to keep one panel as expanded state always. This is applicable for `Single` expand mode.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/accordion/how-to/open-always-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/accordion/how-to/open-always-cs1" %}
